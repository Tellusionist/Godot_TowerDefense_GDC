This is a **Godot tower defense learning project** that follows [this YouTube tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFdpCGbrVXI&list=PLZ-54sd-DMAJltIzTtZ6ZhC-9hkqYXyp6) by _Game Development Center_.  
The goal of this project is to learn the fundamentals of **Godot 4.5**, game architecture, and tower defense mechanics â€” while building something playable and fun.
